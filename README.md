Welcome to Unicorn Ads, a self-paced workshop that will teach you how to achieve multi-region database persistance for your web app that is backed by a container based backend on AWS. You will create,
verify, and test a persistant multi-region database solution on AWS. This 400 level re:Invent Builder Session is designed for developers and system architects who are familiar with Amazon Web Services, databases, backend and frontend web development, and command-line tools.

Unicorn Ads is a startup based out of the Silicon Valley that has entered the online marketplace arena.

This workshop is split into two sections outlined below. You will need to build and host the frontend user interface and the container based backend.

**Backend** - This is the container based backend API that will serve the ads to the frontend. It will also allow you to choose what database in what region the backend should be using.

**Frontend** - This is the user interface that will display the ads posted by users in the marketplace.
